An AI assistant that lives in your browser sidebar. Built for collaboration, not autonomy theater. You guide, it executes.

Sitegeist can automate repetitive web tasks, extract data from any website, navigate across pages, fill out forms, compare products, compile research, and transform what it finds into documents, spreadsheets, or whatever you need. It works on any website through a Chrome/Edge side panel, using the AI provider of your choice.

Bring your own API key or log in with an existing subscription (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI/ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini). Your data stays on your machine. Nothing is collected or tracked.

## Building & Install

```bash
npm run build
```

Load `dist-chrome/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome/Edge (see Development section below).

Requires Chrome 141+ or Edge equivalent.

## Development

Clone this repo plus its sibling dependencies into the same parent directory:

```
parent/
  mini-lit/          # https://github.com/badlogic/mini-lit
  pi-mono/           # https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono
  sitegeist/         # this repo
```

Install dependencies in each repo:

```bash
(cd ../mini-lit && npm install)
(cd ../pi-mono && npm install)
npm install
```

`npm install` sets up the Husky pre-commit hook automatically.

Start all dev watchers (mini-lit, pi-mono, sitegeist extension, marketing site):

```bash
./dev.sh
```

Changes in `../mini-lit` or `../pi-mono` are rebuilt automatically and picked up by the sitegeist watcher.

To run only the extension watcher without dependencies or the marketing site:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Loading the extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click Load unpacked
4. Select `sitegeist/dist-chrome/`
5. Click "Details" on the Sitegeist extension and enable:
   - **Allow user scripts**
   - **Allow access to file URLs**

The extension hot-reloads when the dev watcher rebuilds.

### First run

On first launch, Sitegeist prompts you to connect at least one AI provider. Enter an API key for your provider.

## Checks

```bash
./check.sh
```

Runs formatting, linting, and type checking for the extension and the `site/` subproject.

The Husky pre-commit hook runs the same checks before each commit.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

The unpacked extension is written to `dist-chrome/`.
